                <p>
                  The focus for iFixit was a solid responsive base, as the client receives many mobile phone repairs. This site was created using a custom Photoshop design into HTML and CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, some jQuery for UI fanciness, a custom WordPress theme, and WordPress PHP manipulation.

                  I worked with the team over at <a href="http://pendulumproductions.com" target="_blank">Pendulum Productions</a> as the front-end coder for this application. I took the Dodge Designs from Photoshop and sliced them into a static HTML and CSS/SASS frame for the team to implement into a Ruby on Rails environment. This project is one of my favorites!

                <h5>How it was done</h5>
                <p>
                  I've been working on my Dad's site since I learned how to slice a table-based layout in pre-Adobe Fireworks. This version was focused on the media player - I wanted it to keep playing even when pages were navigated to and fro. The solution was AJAX, mixed in with a custom design from a Static HTML and CSS Photoshop slice, into a custom WordPress theme.

                <h5>How it was done</h5>
                <p>
                  Pikkas wanted a clean, professional WordPress site with some flavor. I set up a WordPress theme from Themeforest for them, adding in functionality for displaying various restaurant menus. This site was mostly WordPress PHP manipulation, with some minor graphical manipulation.

                  Renew IT has a strong Spanish-speaking client base. The emphasis for them was something simple that could display both English and Spanish. The solution was AJAX which switched between EN/ES WordPress pages. This site was conjured in Photoshop, sliced into static HTML and CSS, and whipped up into a custom WordPress theme. The site is no longer live due to domain troubles.

                  Level Up has been one of my longest-stretching projects. The first iteration of this site was in 2011 - it has since gone through Joomla and Drupal, finally ending up in WordPress. This site was sliced from a custom design focused on being shiny and clean, into static HTML and CSS with some jQuery, and finally into a custom WordPress theme.

            Welcome to my little slice of job-seeking heaven. I’m a hybrid developer/designer in the Denver area looking for the right opportunity with a lovely group of individuals. I’ve got several years of experience under my belt working solo freelance, as well as on (very) small teams. My strengths are on the front-end of the web - I love taking gorgeous designs and slicing them into fully-functional web sites. I’ve also worked heavily with the WordPress CMS creating custom themes. <a href="#portfolio">Check out my portfolio</a> to see the work I’ve done. You can even <a href="https://github.com/pstrawberriedev/portfolio" target="_blank">grab the source for this site</a> and peruse away! If you think I might be a good fit for your team...

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
              When I was in 8th grade, I got my very own computer from the local PC shop. In between games of Counter-strike, I fiddled around with Yahoo’s Geocities and made a couple web sites about Star Wars and other awesome stuff. I soon picked up paint shop pro and some very basic HTML. I registered a domain, got a cheap host with my parents’ credit card, and made a site to host homework assignments and notes. I ran it for a few months until my teachers told me to take it down. It seemed students began skipping class notes...slackers.<br /><br />
              The rest is history! I worked in the retail industry for a long while before realizing that I could turn my hobby into something that might eventually support me financially and bring me much more joy than dealing with grumpy people in a check-out line. Over the years, I’ve developed my skills making web sites for family members, local organizations, friends, and my own personal projects. I’ve finally reached the point where I can do this for a living!<br /><br />
              What I love about making web sites is the freedom and the expression. I can create a design that adheres to modern web standards while injecting my own flavor into the mix. I can work in my customized environment, tucked away in my own little world, create shortcuts that increase the efficiency of my work flow...all the while knowing I am doing something I actually enjoy. It’s a beautiful career; one I hadn’t even imagined was possible. I’m very thankful for the internet and the unique opportunity it has allowed me.

            <h2>Personal</h2>
            <p>
              I am a lively chap with a chipper, cordial disposition. I believe in traversing life with a sense of humility and an open mind. In my spare time, you'll generally find me writing, watching films, or playing a computer game. I've taken to a minimal style, both in my creations and in my personal life - I appreciate simplicity and space.<br /><br />
              Second to creating web sites, I very much enjoy psychology. I think humans are very interesting creatures; I'm an avid fan of emotions and their diverse forms of colorful display.<br /><br />
              Janeway is my favorite captain, followed closely by Picard and Sisko. I'm a chili-cheese Frito fiend and I take my coffee #000.
